/*
React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child 
components by giving them props. Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through 
them, including objects, arrays, and functions.
*/

//---------------------------------Familiar props---------------------------------------------
/*
Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, className, src, alt, width, and height are some of the 
props you can pass to an <img>:
function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/1bX5QH6.jpg"
      alt="Lin Lanying"
      width={100}
      height={100}
    />
  );
}

The props you can pass to an <img> tag are predefined (ReactDOM conforms to the HTML standard). But you can pass any 
props to your own components, such as <Avatar>, to customize them.
*/

//------------------------------Passing props to a component-------------------------------------------
/*
You can give Avatar some props in two steps.

Step 1: Pass props to the child component 
First, pass some props to Avatar. For example, let’s pass two props: person (an object), and size (a number):
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Avatar
      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}
      size={100}
    />
  );
}

Now you can read these props inside the Avatar component.

Step 2: Read props inside the child component 
You can read these props by listing their names person, size separated by the commas inside ({ and }) directly after 
function Avatar. This lets you use them inside the Avatar code, like you would with a variable.
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // person and size are available here
}

Props let you think about parent and child components independently. For example, you can change the person or the size 
props inside Profile without having to think about how Avatar uses them. Similarly, you can change how the Avatar uses 
these props, without looking at the Profile.

You can think of props like “knobs” that you can adjust. They serve the same role as arguments serve for functions—in fact, 
props are the only argument to your component! React component functions accept a single argument, a props object.
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...
}
Usually you don’t need the whole props object itself, so you destructure it into individual props.

PITFALL:
Don’t miss the pair of { and } curlies inside of ( and ) when declaring props:
function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  // ...
}
This syntax is called “destructuring” and is equivalent to reading properties from a function parameter:
function Avatar(props) {
  let person = props.person;
  let size = props.size;
  // ...
}
*/

//---------------------------------Specifying a default value for a prop--------------------------------------------
/*
If you want to give a prop a default value to fall back on when no value is specified, you can do it with the 
destructuring by putting = and the default value right after the parameter:

function Avatar({ person, size = 100 }) {
  // ...
}
Now, if <Avatar person={...} /> is rendered with no size prop, the size will be set to 100.

The default value is only used if the size prop is missing or if you pass size={undefined}. But if you pass size={null} 
or size={0}, the default value will not be used.
*/

//--------------------------------Forwarding props with the JSX spread syntax------------------------------------------
/*
Sometimes, passing props gets very repetitive:
function Profile({ person, size, isSepia, thickBorder }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar
        person={person}
        size={size}
        isSepia={isSepia}
        thickBorder={thickBorder}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

There’s nothing wrong with repetitive code—it can be more legible. But at times you may value conciseness. Some components 
forward all of their props to their children, like how this Profile does with Avatar. Because they don’t use any of their 
props directly, it can make sense to use a more concise “spread” syntax.
function Profile(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Avatar {...props} />
    </div>
  );
}

This forwards all of Profile’s props to the Avatar without listing each of their names.
Use spread syntax with restraint. If you’re using it in every other component, something is wrong. Often, it indicates 
that you should split your components and pass children as JSX. 
*/

//----------------------------------------Passing JSX as children------------------------------------------------------
/*
Sometimes you’ll want to nest your own components:
<Card>
  <Avatar />
</Card>

When you nest content inside a JSX tag, the parent component will receive that content in a prop called children. For 
example, the Card component below will receive a children prop set to <Avatar /> and render it in a wrapper div.

Try replacing the <Avatar> inside <Card> with some text to see how the Card component can wrap any nested content. 
It doesn’t need to “know” what’s being rendered inside of it. You will see this flexible pattern in many places.

You can think of a component with a children prop as having a “hole” that can be “filled in” by its parent components with 
arbitrary JSX. You will often use the children prop for visual wrappers: panels, grids, etc.

export function getImageUrl(person, size = 's') {
    return (
      'https://i.imgur.com/' +
      person.imageId +
      size +
      '.jpg'
    );
  }

export function Avatar({ person, size }) {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
      width={size}
      height={size}
    />
  );
}

function Card({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Avatar
        size={100}
        person={{ 
          name: 'Katsuko Saruhashi',
          imageId: 'YfeOqp2'
        }}
      />
    </Card>
  );
}

//----------------------------------How props change over time-------------------------------------------------
/*
A component may receive different props over time. Props are not always static! Here, the time prop changes every second, 
and the color prop changes when you select another color. Props reflect a component’s data at any point in time, rather 
than only in the beginning.
However, props are immutable—a term from computer science meaning “unchangeable”. When a component needs to change its 
props (for example, in response to a user interaction or new data), it will have to “ask” its parent component to pass 
it different props—a new object! Its old props will then be cast aside, and eventually the JavaScript engine will reclaim 
the memory taken by them.
Don’t try to “change props”. When you need to respond to the user input (like changing the selected color), you will need 
to “set state”, which you can learn about in State: A Component’s Memory.
*/

//RECAP
/*
Recap
- To pass props, add them to the JSX, just like you would with HTML attributes.
- To read props, use the function Avatar({ person, size }) destructuring syntax.
- You can specify a default value like size = 100, which is used for missing and undefined props.
- You can forward all props with <Avatar {...props} /> JSX spread syntax, but don’t overuse it!
- Nested JSX like <Card><Avatar /></Card> will appear as Card component’s children prop.
- Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props.
- You can’t change props. When you need interactivity, you’ll need to set state.
