/*You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data. You can use the JavaScript array 
methods to manipulate an array of data. On this page, you’ll use filter() and map() with React to filter and transform 
your array of data into an array of components.
*/

//------------------------------Rendering data from arrays----------------------------------------
/*
Say that you have a list of content.
<ul>
  <li>Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician</li>
  <li>Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist</li>
  <li>Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist</li>
  <li>Percy Lavon Julian: chemist</li>
  <li>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist</li>
</ul>

The only difference among those list items is their contents, their data. You will often need to show several instances 
of the same component using different data when building interfaces: from lists of comments to galleries of profile 
images. In these situations, you can store that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like map() and 
filter() to render lists of components from them.

Here’s a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array:

Move the data into an array:
const people = [
  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',
  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',
  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
];
Map the people members into a new array of JSX nodes, listItems:
const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>);

Return listItems from your component wrapped in a <ul>:
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
*/

const people = [
  "Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician",
  "Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist",
  "Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist",
  "Percy Lavon Julian: chemist",
  "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist",
];

export default function List() {
  // let listItem = people.map((person)=>(<li>{person}</li>));
  // return <ul>{listItem}</ul>
  return (
    <ul>
      {people.map((person) => (
        <li>{person}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

/*
Notice the code above displays a console error:
Console
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop.

//This data can be structured even more.

/*
Let’s say you want a way to only show people whose profession is 'chemist'.The “test” function for this looks like 
(person) => person.profession === 'chemist'. Here’s how to put it together.

Create a new array of just “chemist” people, chemists, by calling filter() on the people filtering by 
person.profession === 'chemist':
const chemists = people.filter(person =>
  person.profession === 'chemist'
);

Now map over chemists:
const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
  <li>
     <img
       src={getImageUrl(person)}
       alt={person.name}
     />
     <p>
       <b>{person.name}:</b>
       {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
       known for {person.accomplishment}
     </p>
  </li>
);
Lastly, return the listItems from your component:
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
*/

export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return "https://i.imgur.com/" + person.imageId + "s.jpg";
}

export function FilteredList() {
  let chemist = peopleDetailed.filter(
    (person) => person.profession === "chemist"
  );
  let chemistList = chemist.map((person) => (
    <li>
      <img src={getImageUrl(person)} alt={person.name} />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {" " + person.profession + " "}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  ));
  return (
    <ul>{chemistList}</ul>
  )
}

/*
PITFALL:
Arrow functions implicitly return the expression right after =>, so you didn’t need a return statement:
const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
  <li>...</li> // Implicit return!
);

However, you must write return explicitly if your => is followed by a { curly brace!
const listItems = chemists.map(person => { // Curly brace
  return <li>...</li>;
});

Arrow functions containing => { are said to have a “block body”. They let you write more than a single line of code, 
but you have to write a return statement yourself. If you forget it, nothing gets returned!
*/

//----------------------------------Keeping list items in order with key------------------------------------------
/*
You need to give each array item a key — a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array:
<li key={person.id}>...</li>

NOTE
JSX elements directly inside a map() call always need keys.

Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important 
if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen key helps React infer 
what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.
Rather than generating keys on the fly, you should include them in your data.

DEEP DIVE:
Displaying several DOM nodes for each list item 

What do you do when each item needs to render not one, but several DOM nodes?

The short <>...</> Fragment syntax won’t let you pass a key, so you need to either group them into a single <div>, or use 
the slightly longer and more explicit <Fragment> syntax:

import { Fragment } from 'react';
// ...
const listItems = people.map(person =>
  <Fragment key={person.id}>
    <h1>{person.name}</h1>
    <p>{person.bio}</p>
  </Fragment>
);
Fragments disappear from the DOM, so this will produce a flat list of <h1>, <p>, <h1>, <p>, and so on.
*/

//-----------------------------------------Where to get your key-------------------------------------------------
/*
Different sources of data provide different sources of keys:

Data from a database: If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs, which are unique by nature.
Locally generated data: If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app), use an 
incrementing counter, crypto.randomUUID() or a package like uuid when creating items.

Rules of keys 
Keys must be unique among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.
Keys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.
*/

//Why does React need keys?
/*
Imagine that files on your desktop didn’t have names. Instead, you’d refer to them by their order — the first file, 
the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file 
would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.

File names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between 
its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position 
changes due to reordering, the key lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.
*/

/*
PITFALL:
You might be tempted to use an item’s index in the array as its key. In fact, that’s what React will use if you don’t 
specify a key at all. But the order in which you render items will change over time if an item is inserted, deleted, or 
if the array gets reordered. Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs.

Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with key={Math.random()}. This will cause keys to never match up between 
renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose 
any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.

Note that your components won’t receive key as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs 
an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: <Profile key={id} userId={id} />.

On this page you learned:
- How to move data out of components and into data structures like arrays and objects.
- How to generate sets of similar components with JavaScript’s map().
- How to create arrays of filtered items with JavaScript’s filter().
- Why and how to set key on each component in a collection so React can keep track of each of them even if their position 
  or data changes.
*/

// EXERCISE
/*
Note that the key is specified on the <Recipe> itself rather than on the root <div> returned from Recipe. This is because 
this key is needed directly within the context of the surrounding array. Previously, you had an array of <div>s so each 
of them needed a key, but now you have an array of <Recipe>s. In other words, when you extract a component, don’t forget 
to leave the key outside the JSX you copy and paste.
